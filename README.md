My pk3 mods need to run with DOOM II wad file

# Information

I create and modify my mods using Ultimate Doom Builder 2, Obsidian, and Slade 3.

I edit them in UDMF ZdF ACS format ID TECH 1.

# About

Based on the DOOM II engine and work with other mods like Brutal Doom or Project Brutal Doom.

# How can I run them?

There are 2 ways:

1: Select Doom II and in the parameters put the name of the pk3 file along with its file extension, example: mod.pk3

2: Drag the pk3 file to the GZ Doom engine executable or any other and open it, then select Doom II.
